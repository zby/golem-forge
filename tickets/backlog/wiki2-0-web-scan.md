# Web Scan for Wiki2.0 Ideas

## Idea
Research modern wiki and knowledge-base tools plus articles describing next-gen wiki experiences to gather interaction and feature ideas that could shape Wiki2.0.

## Why
Grounding our roadmap in real-world patterns should reveal differentiators, UX conventions, and gaps worth filling before we invest heavily in implementation.

## Rough Scope
- Identify 5-10 contemporary wiki/knowledge-base products and community write-ups about "Wiki 2.0" concepts
- Capture notable features, flows, and positioning for each source (screenshots/links/notes)
- Synthesize recurring themes and novel ideas into a concise summary and opportunity list

## Why Not Now
Core Wiki2.0 architecture decisions are still forming; pausing until the current design spike lands keeps research aligned with the right constraints.

## Trigger to Activate
Once the architecture/design spike is settled or there is bandwidth for discovery work ahead of detailed Wiki2.0 planning.
