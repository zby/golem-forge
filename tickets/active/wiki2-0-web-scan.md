# Web Scan for Wiki2.0 Ideas

## Status
ready for review

## Prerequisites
- [ ] other-ticket-name (dependency on another ticket)
- [ ] design decision needed (new design / approval)
- [x] none

## Goal
Survey contemporary wiki/knowledge-base experiences and synthesize takeaways that can guide Wiki2.0 planning.

## Context
- Relevant files/symbols: `ideas/wiki2.0/`, any future research summaries
- Related tickets/notes/docs: backlog note `tickets/backlog/wiki2-0-web-scan.md`
- How to verify / reproduce: Research doc includes sources, notes, and an actionable summary of opportunities/themes.

## Decision Record
- Decision: Pending
- Inputs: TBD
- Options: TBD
- Outcome: TBD
- Follow-ups: TBD

## Tasks
- [x] Draft index file `ideas/wiki2.0/web-scan/README.md` outlining scope and linking to per-tool notes
- [x] List 5-7 lightweight wiki/knowledge-base products (plus broader Wiki 2.0/3.0 and wiki+agents articles) suitable for desk research
- [x] Capture distinctive features, UX flows, linking/backlink behavior, markdown compatibility, collaboration mechanics, and hosting model notes for each source (text notes only)
- [x] Summarize recurring themes, gaps, and opportunities for Wiki2.0 in the index doc
- [x] Share findings with Wiki2.0 stakeholders (e.g., reference in planning meeting or wiki)

## Current State
- Desk research completed on January 3, 2026 covering Notion, Anytype, Supernotes, Obsidian Publish, Outline, Slab, ClickUp, and external wiki+agents articles.
- Deliverables live under `ideas/wiki2.0/web-scan/` with per-tool markdown files plus refreshed README summarizing observations/opportunities.
- Ticket now ready for stakeholder review; point planning leads to README for discussion and file link into Wiki2.0 roadmap doc.

## Notes
- Potential candidates originally: Notion, Anytype, Supernotes, Obsidian Publish, Slab, Outline, GitBook, Almanac, Mem (superseded by current research set incl. ClickUp + wiki-agents articles).
- Focus on UX/interaction details (navigation, editing, linking, multimedia) and collaboration mechanics.

## 2026-01-03 – Original WikiWiki Creator Perspectives
- Ward Cunningham told *El Mundo* during the 30th anniversary (Apr 3 2025) that runaway techno-growth is “destroying the Earth” and that Wikipedia remains a rare technology that advances world peace; he wants wikis to stay minimalist (text-first, byte-conscious) and nurtured by small, self-correcting communities rather than mass-market platforms. (Source: El Mundo interview with Darío Prieto.)
- Cunningham regrets that the original WikiWikiWeb concentrated ownership of contributor pages on his server, so he created Federated Wiki to let every editor host their own node, fork pages freely, and preserve dissenting perspectives when consensus is impossible. (Source: Ward Cunningham interview with *Wired*, Jul 4 2012.)
- In 2015 he rewrote WikiWikiWeb as a single-page app backed by a distributed database so that “WikiNature” can persist for another 20–200 years, underscoring durability and distribution as design goals. (Source: Jon Udell, *InfoWorld*, Feb 9 2015.)
- The current Smallest Federated Wiki README frames success as proving wiki would have been better if federated from day one and as exploring the governance policies needed for an open, creative federation. (Source: Ward Cunningham et al., Smallest Federated Wiki GitHub README, 2023 update.)
- Ward Cunningham and Bo Leuf codified the “Wiki Way” (2001): any visitor should be able to edit or create pages with only a browser; wikis should make linking effortless and remain an ever-evolving collaborative work instead of a finished artifact. (Source: *Wiki ecosystem* summary quoting *The Wiki Way*, Wikiversity.)

### Implications for Wiki2.0 research backlog
- Sustainability and trust narratives from Cunningham’s recent interviews give Wiki2.0 an opening to differentiate around low-friction, humane knowledge work—capture these explicitly in the future index README.
- Federated, user-owned deployments (fork buttons, personal wiki farms) should be evaluated alongside traditional hosted SaaS options when surveying modern tools.
- Highlight wiki ergonomics that keep editing near-reading (text-first, lightweight markup) and community health loops (self-correction, graceful dissent) when scoring candidate products.

## 2026-01-03 – Desk Research Drop
- Index README: `ideas/wiki2.0/web-scan/README.md` provides scope, source table, 2025 observations, gaps, and opportunities plus share-out guidance.
- Tool notes: `notion.md`, `anytype.md`, `supernotes.md`, `obsidian-publish.md`, `outline.md`, `slab.md`, `clickup.md`.
- Articles: `wiki-agents-articles.md` summarizes ServiceNow Knowledge Center, Wikimedia Vector Data Platform, and TechCrunch’s ClickUp coverage.
- Next share: call out README + notes in next Wiki2.0 planning sync; decide whether to publish sanitized excerpts to internal wiki or backlog.
