# Web Scan for Wiki2.0 Ideas

## Status
ready for implementation

## Prerequisites
- [ ] other-ticket-name (dependency on another ticket)
- [ ] design decision needed (new design / approval)
- [x] none

## Goal
Survey contemporary wiki/knowledge-base experiences and synthesize takeaways that can guide Wiki2.0 planning.

## Context
- Relevant files/symbols: `ideas/wiki2.0/`, any future research summaries
- Related tickets/notes/docs: backlog note `tickets/backlog/wiki2-0-web-scan.md`
- How to verify / reproduce: Research doc includes sources, notes, and an actionable summary of opportunities/themes.

## Decision Record
- Decision: Pending
- Inputs: TBD
- Options: TBD
- Outcome: TBD
- Follow-ups: TBD

## Tasks
- [ ] Draft index file `ideas/wiki2.0/web-scan/README.md` outlining scope and linking to per-tool notes
- [ ] List 5-7 lightweight wiki/knowledge-base products (plus broader Wiki 2.0/3.0 and wiki+agents articles) suitable for desk research
- [ ] Capture distinctive features, UX flows, linking/backlink behavior, markdown compatibility, collaboration mechanics, and hosting model notes for each source (text notes only)
- [ ] Summarize recurring themes, gaps, and opportunities for Wiki2.0 in the index doc
- [ ] Share findings with Wiki2.0 stakeholders (e.g., reference in planning meeting or wiki)

## Current State
Clarified scope with user: focus on lightweight, low-friction wikis (Notion alternatives) using desk research only; output will be per-tool notes under `ideas/wiki2.0/web-scan/` plus an index README. Ready to begin implementation.

## Notes
- Potential candidates: Notion, Anytype, Supernotes, Obsidian Publish, Slab, Outline, GitBook, Almanac, Mem
- Focus on UX/interaction details (navigation, editing, linking, multimedia) and collaboration mechanics.
