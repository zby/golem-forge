# ClickUp

## Snapshot
- **Positioning:** Project management suite expanding into knowledge management with Docs Hub, verified wikis, and AI “Brain” agents embedded alongside tasks.
- **Why it matters for Wiki2.0:** Illustrates how PM tools are bundling doc governance, imports, and agentic drafting into a single workflow surface.

## 2025 Releases & Signals
- **Knowledge Management launch (Oct 1 2025):** TechCrunch previewed ClickUp’s push into verified wikis, automated importers (Confluence, Notion, Google Docs), duplicate detection, and governance policies—highlighting market demand for AI-assisted hygiene. (TechCrunch live demo, Oct 1 2025)
- **ClickUp Brain + Super Agents:** Brain now summarizes docs, answers questions, and drafts updates inline; Super Agents auto-triage tasks/doc changes based on monitored work. (ClickUp Brain product page, 2025 refresh)
- **Docs Hub telemetry:** Official KM page emphasizes freshness tracking, ownership, and automated reminders when docs go stale—mirrors Slab/ServiceNow analytics.

## UX & Flow Notes
- Docs live beside tasks/goals; global search covers work + knowledge. Docs Hub surfaces duplicates, stale docs, and owners.
- Verified wiki workflow: editors propose updates, maintainers approve, and Brain surfaces the latest answer to end-users.
- Imports keep formatting + metadata so teams can migrate from existing wiki with minimal cleanup.

## Markdown & Content Model
- Rich block editor with slash menu, tables, code, embeds, AI commands. Doc structure stored as blocks but exports to Markdown/HTML remain available.
- Metadata fields (owner, status, freshness, team) appear in Docs Hub filters—similar to Notion database properties.

## Collaboration & Governance
- Permissions inherited from Workspaces, but KM adds review assignments, verification badges, and reminders. AI Brain can suggest changes but humans approve.
- Super Agents can watch automations (e.g., “monitor for stale runbooks”); design goal is to keep doc hygiene inside same queue as tasks.

## Hosting / Deployment
- Managed SaaS with SOC2, SSO/SCIM. No self-hosting, but APIs/webhooks exist for automation; integrates with task platform + external sources via connectors.

## Distinctive Cues for Wiki2.0
- Combining PM + wiki ensures docs stay tied to workstreams; consider linking wiki changes to task/issue trackers automatically.
- Docs Hub governance (verification badges, freshness reminders) is now table stakes in AI era; plan comparable dashboards.
- Importers + AI cleanup reduce migration friction—worth planning for Git-based importer + agent to help restructure Markdown.
