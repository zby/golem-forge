# Slab

## Snapshot
- **Positioning:** Opinionated team wiki with guided information architecture, doc health analytics, and editorial workflows suited for onboarding-heavy orgs.
- **Why it matters for Wiki2.0:** Shows how structured review + “knowledge requests” make wikis feel serviced rather than passive doc dumps.

## 2024–2025 Releases & Signals
- **Hint blocks & image comments (Apr 24 2025):** Adds inline helper callouts and per-annotation comments on images—helps doc authors pre-empt confusion (Slab updates blog).
- **Post History timeline (Jan 24 2024):** Visual timeline of versions plus “copy link to version,” reducing fear of editing shared playbooks (Slab product update).
- **Team Insights + Content Requests:** Insights dashboard tracks freshness, ownership, and impact; knowledge requests let teammates ask questions and get routed to doc owners (product site, 2024 refresh).

## UX & Flow Notes
- Sidebar topics + favorites; overview pages for each topic surface featured docs and stats.
- Editor mixes Markdown shortcuts with WYSIWYG blocks, `/` command palette, embeds (Figma, Loom, Google Docs), and AI writing partner.
- Linking/backlinks: `@` doc linking plus Related Docs suggestions; inline link recommendations appear while typing.
- Polished reading view with callouts, hint blocks, highlight-to-comment, and image annotations.

## Markdown & Content Model
- Imports Markdown/Google Docs; exports Markdown/HTML/PDF. Each doc has metadata (owner, status, tags) displayed on cover.
- Status + tags feed Insights; API exposes doc objects with metadata for automation.

## Collaboration Mechanics
- Roles (admin, owner, writer, read-only, guest) + topic-level permissions. Draft → review → publish pipeline with notifications.
- Inline comments, suggestions, version diff viewer, and doc health analytics.
- Knowledge Requests convert teammate questions into tasks tied to docs, closing loops.

## Hosting / Deployment
- Cloud SaaS only; enterprise plan adds SCIM, SSO, audit logs, analytics export.

## Distinctive Cues for Wiki2.0
- Dedicated Insights dashboard shows freshness + readership; something Git-backed wikis should match.
- Knowledge Requests behave like helpdesk tickets for wiki gaps—great pattern for triaging agent suggestions.
- Image comments + hint blocks show value of rich media annotations for hardware/process docs.
