# Supernotes

## Snapshot
- **Positioning:** Networked notecard system centered on atomic “cards,” fast capture, and multiplayer knowledge curation.
- **Why it matters for Wiki2.0:** Shows how constrained card shapes plus backlinks keep contributions tidy and digestible—useful for AI agents that thrive on small chunks.

## 2024–2025 Releases & Signals
- **Version 3.2 (Sep 2024):** Introduced AI Superpowers (summaries, question-answer, translation) plus a Flashcard review mode so learners keep knowledge fresh inside the same workspace (Supernotes blog, Sep 13 2024).
- **Mobile 3.2.1 (Oct 2024):** Redesigned iOS/Android apps with command palette, offline cache, and Actions drawer, showing commitment to capture-anywhere workflows (release notes, Oct 4 2024).
- **Reference Manager (Nov 2024):** Added bibliography metadata, citation types, and export helpers for academic cards—demonstrates how strict metadata boosts reuse (product update, Nov 25 2024).

## UX & Flow Notes
- **Navigation:** Notebook + tag hierarchy on the left, global CMD+K palette, and per-card focus mode.
- **Editing:** Slash commands + Markdown shortcuts; cards enforce concise sections with titles, keeping diffs tight.
- **Linking/backlinks:** `[[Card]]` mentions, inline embeds, and backlinks shown as References; cards can belong to multiple collections/stacks for multi-parent hierarchies.
- **Collections:** Tag, Stack, and Filter views let teams surface cards by topic, owner, or freshness; Works nicely for dashboards.

## Markdown & Content Model
- Supports headings, lists, code, callouts; exports Markdown/JSON with metadata (tags, reactions, backlinks).
- Cards store created/updated timestamps, owners, reactions, XP counts—metadata accessible via API for automation.

## Collaboration Mechanics
- Real-time co-editing with cursors, inline comments, emoji reactions, and XP reputation.
- Card inbox + activity feed highlights changes; digest emails keep watchers up-to-date.

## Hosting / Deployment
- Cloud SaaS with desktop/web/mobile; offline cache syncs once online; API + upcoming plugins enable deeper automations.

## Distinctive Features to Note
- Card size constraint prevents sprawling pages; fosters atomic knowledge ideal for AI summarization.
- Reference Manager + Flashcards demonstrate mixing knowledge capture + spaced repetition inside same wiki.
- XP/reputation loops show gentle gamification for contributions without heavy moderation.

## Opportunities for Wiki2.0
- Adopt “card-per-concept” for agentic diffs—LLMs can target single cards, making review easier.
- Embed reference metadata + citation helpers near content so bots can cite sources.
- Provide retention loops (flashcards, review requests) tied to stale cards to keep wiki alive.
