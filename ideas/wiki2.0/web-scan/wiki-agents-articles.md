# Wiki 2.0 / Agents Articles

## ServiceNow “Knowledge Center” (Apr 30 2024)
- **Premise:** Generative AI copilots produce stronger answers when anchored to curated knowledge centers that include metadata, governance policies, and verification badges. (ServiceNow Workflow blog)
- **Key takeaways:**
  - Knowledge Center tiles highlight freshness, usage, and owner so AI assistants (Now Assist) can cite trusted results.
  - Includes duplicate detection, policy grouping, and “knowledge tasks” so stewards can triage gaps like support tickets.
  - Reinforces that enterprise buyers expect wikis to expose metrics + task queues natively for both humans and LLMs.
- **Relevance:** Wiki2.0 should plan similar freshness dashboards, policy segregation, and task automation before layering agents.

## Wikimedia Deutschland “Vector Data Platform” (Feb 26 2025)
- **Premise:** Wikimedia is building a new vector and embeddings platform so AI companies can license high-quality knowledge with provenance to reduce hallucinations. (Wikimedia Foundation + Vector Project announcement)
- **Key takeaways:**
  - Introduces APIs for “knowledge snapshots” (temporal slices) plus provenance metadata for each entity.
  - Includes a “knowledge responsibility lab” to test models against Wikipedia fidelity before release.
  - Emphasizes negotiation, licensing, and safety audit layers around knowledge graphs—beyond simple dumps.
- **Relevance:** Suggests Wiki2.0 should consider packaging snapshots + provenance for internal agents (e.g., signed datasets or export endpoints).

## TechCrunch “ClickUp wants companies to think of it as a knowledge management tool” (Oct 1 2025)
- **Premise:** Productivity suites are bundling wikis with AI to stay sticky; ClickUp’s release highlights verification workflows, duplicate detection, and imports to clean data for agents (Brain/Super Agents).
- **Key takeaways:**
  - Verified wikis + doc governance are core differentiators; AI answers cite the verified source.
  - Imports from Notion/Confluence/Google Docs plus restructure suggestions lower migration friction.
  - Embedding knowledge tasks into PM suite keeps docs tied to daily work (tickets, OKRs) so upkeep isn’t a separate ritual.
- **Relevance:** Reinforces idea that Wiki2.0 should integrate tightly with work management and AI helpers, not live as a standalone site.

## Cross-article prompts
- Treat knowledge operations like a product: freshness scores, duplicate detection, ownership metadata, and work queues should be built-in.
- Package knowledge for AI consumption via snapshots, embedding APIs, or policy-aware exports (Wikimedia model).
- Provide explicit review lanes for AI-suggested changes (ServiceNow Knowledge Tasks, ClickUp verification) instead of free-form editing.
